## What is Rosetta?

Rosetta is a Twitter-like platform where people can write thoughts, opinions, anything, in a blockchain. Since posts - called "stones" in Rosetta - can't be deleted, the writings will stand there as long as the chain exists. The main objective is to keep records that last longer than a tweet, without much of the "social" aspect of social networks. Therefore, people can rely on the anonimity of the blockchain technology to share what they are thinking without the drawbacks of a user data selling driven platform.

Rosetta is a platform where people can write anything, anytime, provided that they've got some Sepolia ether and a MetaMask wallet. The contract itself is available at *0xF744073FDE4d0f259624e675620587F69efA924C* (at least for now - I'll add some stuff later, and then I'll update the contract address) and the code is at the *contracts* folder. Everything can be audited at any block explorer, but I personally use Blockscout (link [here](https://eth-sepolia.blockscout.com/address/0xF744073FDE4d0f259624e675620587F69efA924C)).
