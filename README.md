## What is Rosetta?

Rosetta is a Twitter-like platform where people can write thoughts, opinions, anything, in a blockchain. Since posts - called "stones" in Rosetta - can't be deleted, the writings will stand there as long as the chain exists. The main objective is to keep records that last longer than a tweet, without much of the "social" aspect of social networks. Therefore, people can rely on the anonimity of the blockchain technology to share what they are thinking without the drawbacks of a user data selling driven platform.

## When it's going to be released?

The version 1.0 has no schedule yet, however, there will be regular updates based on how much time I've got to spend on the project. Hopefuly there'll be a stable release at late August.
